              The kickoff for Manager Hub began with aligning on business needs
              from stakeholders. We followed Agile methodology, structuring work
              into sprints to keep progress transparent and iterative.

                                     Our primary users were internal managers across Walmart, Sam&apos;s Club,
              and Campus corporate teams. This included both hourly and salaried
              managers responsible for store operations and associate management.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed text-sm sm:text-base">
              The goal was to deeply understand manager needs around performance
              tracking, associate transfers, birthdays and achievements, and goal
              management â€” all consolidated into one intuitive platform.
